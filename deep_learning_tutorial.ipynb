A CNN is a type of neural network that applies a series of filters, using convolutions, followed by spatial pooling, in sequence to extract increasingly powerful and abstract features from the input image [[citation](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2999134.2999257)].\n",

CNNs are typically deep neural networks that consist of many convolutional layers, with the output from one convolutional layer forming the input to the next. The last layers of a CNN are usually fully connected layers, where the output layer is followed by a sigmoid or softmax activation function.\n",

    "It's important to note that the CNN was trained on a much more limited piece of information compared to the fully-connected network (FCN). While the FCN was trained on many well understood physics informations, such as the track length, direction, and energy deposited, the CNN was only trained on 2D signatures of the tracks. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the CNN is worse than the FCN. It's important for scientists to understand which method is best for each situation, and in this case, the CNN was able to achieve a respectable accuracy given its limited input information. In fact, by adding capacity to the CNN by designing wider and deeper networks, it's possible to improve upon the results achieved by the FCN."
